## LED_Fade

### Description & Code
The LED fade assingment was the first arduino assingment I was assinged. This assingment was easy because what you have to do is upload the code provided by arduino, and then do the wiring.

Here's how you make code look like code:

```C++
  int led = 9;           // the PWM pin the LED is attached to
int brightness = 0;    // how bright the LED is
int fadeAmount = 5;    // how many points to fade the LED by

// the setup routine runs once when you press reset:
void setup() {
  // declare pin 9 to be an output:
  pinMode(led, OUTPUT);
}
```
